# Context Summary - Year 2026 Planning

## Previous Year Review: 2025

### Major Goals/Intentions
- No explicit goals set
- Reactive approach: took consulting projects as they came
- No system for soliciting/chasing consulting work
- Personal projects alongside consulting work
- **Shift late 2025/early 2026:** Personal projects moved to center stage

### What Was Achieved

**Google Consulting Projects:**
- Flutter AI Toolkit shipped in v10 (based on his work)
- Dart Pad AI coding features
- Best practices for Flutter AI with crossword solving puzzle sample
- Firebase comics segment sample (tech-dependent, delivered late in year)

**Klein Consulting:**
- 3-month product and devrel consulting engagement
- Delivered on promises
- Interim Chief Product Officer role

**Energy Startup:**
- 1 week AI engineering exploration
- Delivered what was promised

**Quality Across the Board:**
- Volume sometimes intense, more than comfortable
- High-quality results delivered consistently
- Handled the workload successfully

**Personal Projects:**
- Two specific projects becoming important
- Believes they're groundbreaking
- Potential foundation for AI agent use
- May turn into actual product(s)

### What Fell Short

**Klein Engagement:**
- Hoped it would turn into full-time job
- Required on-site presence in San Francisco (not viable)
- Went every other week, but needed to live there
- Leadership role not feasible remotely
- Disappointing outcome in retrospect

**Energy Startup:**
- Didn't turn into more work
- CEO was "bitter pill to swallow"
- Mutual lack of interest in continuing
- Didn't hide feelings well enough

**Consulting Pipeline:**
- No system for tracking down consulting work
- Everything came as surprises
- Has opportunities for new proposals but hasn't followed up
- Not prioritizing consulting pursuit

### What Surprised

**All Consulting Was Surprise-Based:**
- No proactive system
- Work came to him
- Tried to follow up on most opportunities
- Volume varied: sometimes intense, sometimes manageable

**Shift in Focus:**
- Personal projects becoming more compelling than consulting
- Will take consulting if it drops in his lap
- Won't spend time tracking down consulting
- Energy going to personal projects that may result in marketable products

## Current State (Early 2026)

### Active Projects

**Personal Projects (Primary Focus):**
1. [Project 1 - name TBD]: Groundbreaking AI agent foundation work
2. [Project 2 - name TBD]: Groundbreaking AI agent foundation work
- Both may turn into products/marketable offerings
- These are where energy and focus are going

**Consulting (Secondary, Reactive):**
- Will accept if it comes to him
- Has proposal opportunities but hasn't followed up
- Not actively pursuing new clients

### Revenue Model Shift
- 2025: Consulting-driven (reactive)
- 2026: Potentially product-driven (if personal projects pan out)
- Consulting remains option if opportunities arrive

### Key Pattern Identified
- High-quality delivery when engaged
- Reactive vs. proactive approach to consulting
- Growing pull toward product/builder work vs. consulting work
- AI agents are the domain of focus
