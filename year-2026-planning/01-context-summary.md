# Context Summary - Year 2026 Planning

## Previous Year Review: 2025

### Major Goals/Intentions
- No explicit goals set
- Reactive approach: took consulting projects as they came
- No system for soliciting/chasing consulting work
- Personal projects alongside consulting work
- **Shift late 2025/early 2026:** Personal projects moved to center stage

### What Was Achieved

**Google Consulting Projects:**
- Flutter AI Toolkit shipped in v10 (based on his work)
- Dart Pad AI coding features
- Best practices for Flutter AI with crossword solving puzzle sample
- Firebase comics segment sample (tech-dependent, delivered late in year)

**Klein Consulting:**
- 3-month product and devrel consulting engagement
- Delivered on promises
- Interim Chief Product Officer role

**Energy Startup:**
- 1 week AI engineering exploration
- Delivered what was promised

**Quality Across the Board:**
- Volume sometimes intense, more than comfortable
- High-quality results delivered consistently
- Handled the workload successfully

**Personal Projects:**
- Two specific projects becoming important
- Believes they're groundbreaking
- Potential foundation for AI agent use
- May turn into actual product(s)

### What Fell Short

**Klein Engagement:**
- Hoped it would turn into full-time job
- Required on-site presence in San Francisco (not viable)
- Went every other week, but needed to live there
- Leadership role not feasible remotely
- Disappointing outcome in retrospect

**Energy Startup:**
- Didn't turn into more work
- CEO was "bitter pill to swallow"
- Mutual lack of interest in continuing
- Didn't hide feelings well enough

**Consulting Pipeline:**
- No system for tracking down consulting work
- Everything came as surprises
- Has opportunities for new proposals but hasn't followed up
- Not prioritizing consulting pursuit

### What Surprised

**All Consulting Was Surprise-Based:**
- No proactive system
- Work came to him
- Tried to follow up on most opportunities
- Volume varied: sometimes intense, sometimes manageable

**Shift in Focus:**
- Personal projects becoming more compelling than consulting
- Will take consulting if it drops in his lap
- Won't spend time tracking down consulting
- Energy going to personal projects that may result in marketable products

## Current State (Early 2026)

### Active Projects

**Personal Projects (Primary Focus):**

1. **Code Swarm/Code Army** - Orchestrated AI agents for code implementation
   - Domain names secured (codeArmy.com/.ai/.bot or similar)
   - Building around Gastown (friend's framework), Flywheel framework coming
   - **Current focus:** Hosting/configuration/provisioning infrastructure
   - **Vision:** UI accessible globally to see running projects, full visibility into orchestrated implementation
   - **Status:** Actively building
   - **Goal:** Turn into a business

2. **Eli** - AI agent with multi-layered memory system
   - Advanced capabilities for execution, planning, orchestration
   - Personal partner for accomplishing tasks
   - Growing, learning memory system
   - **Current focus:** Building out memory architecture and capabilities
   - **Status:** Going well, actively developing
   - **Goal:** Productize

**Integration Vision:** Code Army + Eli = AI COO/Chief of Staff controlling coding armies. Could be two products, one product building on another, or one integrated offering.

**Consulting (Secondary, Reactive):**
- All contracts completed (pending income hasn't landed yet)
- Zero active consulting commitments
- Will accept if opportunities arrive naturally
- Has proposal opportunities but not following up
- Not actively pursuing new clients

### Ongoing Responsibilities

**Family (Age 56):**
- Two grown sons, 5-year-old grandson, wife
- Primary financial responsibility: mortgage, day-to-day expenses
- Significant retirement savings (letting it build)
- Income transition: Consulting covered expenses in 2025, likely to drop in 2026 as focus shifts to products (before they generate revenue)

**Health/Fitness (Major Priority & 2025 Achievement):**
- Lost almost 60 lbs in 2025
- A1C down significantly - out of prediabetes range (was prediabetic/diabetic)
- Uses GLP-1s
- Exercises 5-6 days/week: water aerobics + weightlifting
- "Made a big difference in my life"
- **Status:** Continue as-is - major accomplishment and ongoing priority

**Community/Open Source:**
- Active participant in open source community
- Maintains multiple open source projects
- Recently gave talk at Google Winter of Code 2026 kickoff (yesterday)
- Giving back to community that's been good to him over the years
- **Status:** Continue as-is - values-driven

### Revenue Model Shift
- 2025: Consulting-driven (reactive, high volume at times)
- 2026: Transitioning to product-driven (before revenue arrives)
- Income gap expected as products develop
- Consulting remains option if opportunities arrive, but not priority

### Key Pattern Identified
- High-quality delivery when engaged
- Reactive vs. proactive approach to consulting
- Strong pull toward product/builder work vs. consulting work
- AI agents are the domain of focus
- Health transformation demonstrates commitment when priorities are set
