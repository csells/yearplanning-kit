# Session Reflection - Year 2026 Planning

**Date:** January 11, 2026
**Session Format:** Multi-session (Phases 1-4 completed previously, Phases 5-8 completed today)

## What Worked Well

### 1. Board Simulation was transformative
The Board didn't just validate the plan—it fundamentally revised it. The shift from "$200K consulting" to "self-invest and reclaim time" emerged through deliberation, not instruction. That's the design working.

### 2. The Sage's reframe dissolved fear
"Dipping into savings" → "Investing in my company." Same money, different meaning. That single reframe resolved the psychological barrier that was shaping PRO1. The Sage's internal lens caught what external analysis couldn't.

### 3. Concrete targets emerged from pressure
"Validated foundation" was vague. When pressed, landed on "100 paying customers." The number isn't magic—the concreteness is. Clear success criteria by December 31.

### 4. Multi-round deliberation allowed depth
5 rounds. Each round surfaced something new. The first round identified tensions; by round 4, refining rather than discovering. The structure held.

### 5. Through-line emerged organically
*"Build what I see, with people I trust, and let the market validate."*
This wasn't prescribed—it surfaced from the deliberation. That's the goal of the Board phase.

### 6. Working files preserved context across sessions
Phases 1-4 in one session, Phase 5+ in another. The markdown files (00-04) provided complete context for continuation. Multi-session planning worked seamlessly.

## What Could Improve

### 1. Boundary structure remains soft
The Guardian raised that "judgment" isn't structure. Answer ("I've done this before, I know the difference") is experience-based confidence, not mechanism. The December test will reveal if this holds. The methodology could push harder here.

### 2. Partnership structure undefined
Five names (Don, Rory, Jeff, Jesse, Steve), no roles formalized. Fine for January, but the plan would benefit from "Partnership Activation" as an explicit Q1 deliverable.

### 3. Price point unresolved
$20/mo vs $200/mo creates different businesses. The plan acknowledges "market will tell you" but doesn't capture this as a lynchpin decision point. Could be sharper.

### 4. Session split worked but wasn't explicitly designed for
Continuity was fine because context was captured in files. The methodology could explicitly support and encourage multi-session planning.

## Suggested Methodology Modifications

### 1. Add "Reframe the Fear" as explicit Board technique
- The Sage's approach was the session's most valuable move
- Make this a named pattern: "When fear language appears, explore the reframe"
- Add to The Sage's key questions: "What if we reframe this fear as investment/opportunity?"

### 2. Add "Partnership Activation" section to final plan template
- List names, potential roles, and Q1 actions
- Current template doesn't capture relationship-building as explicit deliverable
- Suggested format:

```markdown
## Partnership Network
| Name | Potential Role | Status | Q1 Action |
|------|---------------|--------|-----------|
```

### 3. Add "Unresolved for Q1" section
- Capture items that need early attention but weren't fully resolved
- Examples from this session:
  - Price point discovery ($20 vs $200)
  - Partnership formalization
  - Boundary structure beyond "judgment"

### 4. Explicitly support multi-session planning
- Add note to methodology: "If session breaks, Phase files preserve context"
- The working files did exactly what they're designed to do
- Consider adding: "Recommended break point: After Phase 4, before Board Simulation"

### 5. Consider Board round compression
- If consensus emerges by round 3-4, move to synthesis
- 5 rounds worked here but could feel long for simpler plans
- Add guidance: "Minimum 3 rounds, maximum 6, move to synthesis when new information stops emerging"

### 6. Push harder on soft answers
- "I'll use my judgment" should trigger follow-up: "What's the structural backup if judgment fails?"
- The Guardian accepted the answer; could have pushed for one concrete mechanism

## Key Quotes from Session

> "That feels good to me." — On reframing savings withdrawal as company investment

> "Wisdom is looking at what everyone else is looking at and seeing what nobody else sees." — Neil Degrasse Tyson (offered by CEO during deliberation)

> "To validate, I don't need to be in the black, but I do need paying customers." — Clarifying PRO2 success criteria

## Metrics for Future Comparison

- **Session duration:** ~2 hours for Phases 5-8 (Board through Next Steps)
- **Board rounds:** 5
- **Major plan revisions:** 1 (PRO1 completely transformed)
- **Through-line emergence:** Yes, organic
- **Rocks count:** 3 (within recommended 3-4 range)

## For Next Year's Planning

1. Review whether December 2026 vacation pattern changed (PRI1 boundary test)
2. Review whether "judgment" was sufficient or if structure was needed
3. Review partnership activation—did the Q1 conversations happen?
4. Compare actual customer count to 100 target
5. Note whether proprietary vs. open source decision was revisited quarterly as recommended
