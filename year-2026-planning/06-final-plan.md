# Year 2026 Plan

## Through-Line
*"Build what I see, with people I trust, and let the market validate."*

## Mission Statement
Create an AI startup with paying customers by year-end, built through partnerships with friends, while completing my health transformation and being fully present for family.

## Big Rocks

### PRO2: Startup Validation (Priority #1)
**Slogan:** "Build with friends, validate with users"
**Outcome:** 100 paying customers by December 31, 2026
**Value:** Building in flow state with people I enjoy; shifting from solo consulting to partnership models; leveraging AI agents in bigger ways; openness and integrity in working with friends; this is who I am as a builder
**Paths:**
- (a) Code Army MVP with early adopters
- (b) Eli productized with partners engaged (Don, Rory, Jeff, Jesse, Steve)
- (c) Integrated offering (AI COO/Chief of Staff) showing traction

**Validation Target:**
- 100 paying customers by EOY
- Price point TBD by market (~$20/mo or ~$200/mo)
- ~$2K MRR demonstrates product-market fit

### PRO1: Strategic Partnerships (Priority #2)
**Slogan:** "Partner through purpose"
**Outcome:** Strategic consulting only when it builds startup infrastructure, partnerships, or capabilities; self-fund runway through investment; say no to everything else
**Value:** Consulting becomes a tactic within the strategy, not competing with it; Jesse-type work builds the business while generating some revenue; maintains relationships that matter
**Decision Filter:** "Does this consulting advance Code Army, Eli, or the partnership network?" If yes, consider. If no, decline regardless of money.

**Key Shift:**
- Self-fund $200K runway through retirement investment (offense, not retreat)
- Reclaim 50-100 days of founder time for product development
- Strategic consulting capped at ~20% of time

### PRI1: Health & Presence
**Slogan:** "Finish strong, be fully present"
**Outcome:** 100 lb weight loss goal achieved (40 lbs remaining) + work/family boundaries working (vacation pattern fixed)
**Value:** Integrity in marriage and family relationships; being present matters more than being productive; completing what I started; the December vacation pattern doesn't define me anymore

**Components:**
- Health: Maintain 5-6 days/week exercise (water aerobics + weightlifting), lose remaining 40 lbs
- Presence: When it's family vacation time, that's it—not working on non-critical items; conscious choices to be present

## Capacity Overview
- **Total working days:** ~237
- **Q1:** ~58 days (Recovery/Building - Post-December, fresh start energy)
- **Q2:** ~63 days (High energy - Consistent, productive period)
- **Q3:** ~64 days (High energy - Consistent, productive period)
- **Q4:** ~52 days (Pressure/Drain - Family celebrations, holiday recovery)

**Prime building periods:** Q2 and Q3
**Plan for recovery, not launches:** December

## Lynchpins
Variables that fork the year's trajectory:

1. **Product-market fit timing** — Early traction (Q2) vs. late traction (Q4) dramatically changes the year's shape
2. **Partnership activation** — Whether Don, Rory, Jeff, Jesse, Steve engage as collaborators or stay potential
3. **Price point discovery** — $20/mo (volume) vs. $200/mo (value) creates different businesses
4. **Open source decision** — Staying proprietary vs. opening base to build audience

## Win Conditions

| Domain | Start of Win | Definite Win |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Startup | 10 paying customers | 100 paying customers |
| Partnerships | 1 active collaboration | 3+ partners building together |
| Revenue | $1K MRR | $5K+ MRR |
| Health | Maintain current habits | 100 lb goal complete |
| Boundaries | One vacation fully present | December 2026 pattern broken |

## Board Guidance Summary

### Do's
- Apply strategic consulting filter ruthlessly—"Does this build the startup?"
- Ship something chargeable in Q2—don't wait for "ready"
- Push partnership conversations early (Q1, not Q3)
- Define "critical" with April before vacations start—shared definition
- Trust the "feels good" signal—body knows before mind
- Let identity shift happen: consultant → founder is a choice
- Revisit proprietary vs. open source quarterly
- Track self-investment explicitly—know monthly burn
- Build in public even if code stays private

### Don'ts
- Don't take consulting for money alone, regardless of amount
- Don't let "strategic" become a loophole—if justifying, you're rationalizing
- Don't wait for perfect MVP—paying customers validate, not features
- Don't let strategic consulting creep past 20% of time
- Don't rebuild the armor: hedges, safety nets, "just in case" consulting
- Don't sacrifice sleep or exercise for startup urgency
- Don't assume December 2026 will be different without changing something
- Don't mistake activity for progress—building feels productive even when it's avoidance

## Core Frictions (Ongoing Tensions)

1. **Time vs. Partnerships:** Strategic consulting serves the startup but still consumes founder time
   - *Manage by:* Hard cap at 20%, ruthless filter, only Jesse-type opportunities

2. **Proprietary vs. Audience:** Keeping IP locked while open source competitors build communities
   - *Manage by:* Quarterly reassessment, build in public even if code is private

3. **Presence vs. Passion:** Work that's deeply engaging makes disconnection harder
   - *Manage by:* Pre-defined "critical" with April, scheduled vacations in Q2/Q3 not December

4. **Speed vs. Quality:** Shipping early to validate vs. building something worth paying for
   - *Manage by:* "Ugly revenue beats beautiful demos"—charge early, iterate on feedback
