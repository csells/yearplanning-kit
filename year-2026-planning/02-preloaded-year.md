# Pre-loaded Year 2026

## Capacity by Quarter

| Quarter | Months | Est. Working Days | Energy Season |
|---------|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Q1 | Jan-Mar | ~58 | Recovery/Building - Post-December drain, fresh start energy |
| Q2 | Apr-Jun | ~63 | High energy - Consistent, productive period |
| Q3 | Jul-Sep | ~64 | High energy - Consistent, productive period |
| Q4 | Oct-Dec | ~52 | Pressure/Drain - Family celebrations, vacation, recovery needed |
| **YEAR** | | **~237 total** | Generally consistent except December |

**Calculation notes:**
- Base: ~252 working days (Mon-Fri, 52 weeks)
- Holidays taken: ~4 days (Christmas Eve/Day, Thanksgiving +1, New Year's)
- Exercise commitment: Already factored into daily routine (5-6 days/week), not reducing working capacity
- Childcare: ~1 day/week = ~50 days, but only 6-8 hours = ~25 working days impact
- Vacation: 1 week = 5 days
- December reduced capacity: ~2 weeks effective time loss
- **Total deductions: ~15 days**
- **Realistic capacity: ~237 working days**

## Time Off & Reduced Capacity

### Fixed Time Off
- **Christmas:** Dec 24-25 (2 days)
- **Thanksgiving:** Nov 27 + buffer day (2 days)
- **New Year's:** Jan 1, 2026 (already past)
- **Vacation:** 1 week planned (5 days) - ideally between wife's PSU semesters

### Reduced Capacity Periods
- **December overall:** Family birthday (Dec 2), anniversary (Dec 29), Christmas Eve party, New Year's Eve neighborhood party, general holiday season
  - Effective capacity reduction: ~2 weeks
- **Grandson childcare:** Once weekly, 6-8 hours (manageable within schedule)

### Vacation Planning Opportunity
- Wife attends Portland State University full-time
- **Recommendation:** Plan week-long vacation between semesters (not December)
  - Winter semester break: Late December/Early January
  - Spring break: March
  - Summer break: June/July
  - Fall break: November
- **Challenge identified:** Struggles to disconnect, gets bored without mental engagement
- **Impact:** December 2025 vacation led to working on laptop, created tension with wife, didn't actually recharge

## Fixed Commitments

### Recurring
- **Exercise:** 5-6 days/week (water aerobics + weightlifting) - morning routine, not reducing work capacity
- **Grandson childcare:** ~Once weekly, 6-8 hours
- **Open source maintenance:** Ongoing but flexible

### Conferences (Flexible/Optional)
- **Flutter Developer Conference:** Attended 2024 (talk), 2025 (keynote) - likely to attend again
  - Typically late summer/fall
  - 2-3 days commitment
- **AI Engineering conferences:** Wants to increase involvement
  - TBD which ones
  - Budget 1-2 conferences

## Energy Notes

### Q1 (Jan-Mar): Recovery/Building
- Post-December energy drain
- Fresh start momentum
- Already 11 days in - how's it feeling?
- Wife's spring semester at PSU underway
- Good time for focused building

### Q2 (Apr-Jun): High Energy
- Consistent, productive period
- No major family events
- Good weather in Portland (less rain)
- Wife's semester ends (late May/early June?)
- Potential vacation window

### Q3 (Jul-Sep): High Energy
- Consistent, productive period
- Summer in Portland - excellent weather
- Wife's summer break (potential vacation window)
- Flutter conference likely in this window
- Potential for high productivity if vacation well-planned

### Q4 (Oct-Dec): Pressure/Drain
- October/November: Still productive
- Thanksgiving: Late November, family gathering
- **December: Major energy drain**
  - Wife's birthday (Dec 2)
  - Anniversary (Dec 29)
  - Christmas Eve party (neighborhood)
  - Christmas Day
  - New Year's Eve party (neighborhood)
  - General holiday season
  - Historically takes vacation this month
- Wife's fall semester ends (mid-December?)
- Plan for recovery, not major launches

## Key Insights for Planning

1. **December is not a productive month** - plan accordingly, don't schedule critical milestones
2. **Vacation strategy needs work** - disconnecting is a skill to develop, affects both recharging and marriage
3. **Q2 and Q3 are prime building periods** - maximize these
4. **Exercise is non-negotiable** - already integrated into daily routine
5. **Childcare is manageable** - once weekly doesn't significantly impact capacity
6. **Conference attendance flexible** - budget 1-2 AI/agent conferences to build community presence
