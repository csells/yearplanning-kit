# Year 2026 Intentions

## Looking Back at 2025

### Proud of:
1. **Health transformation and results** - Lost 60 lbs, A1C out of prediabetes range, established 5-6 day/week exercise habit (water aerobics + weightlifting)
2. **High-quality consulting delivery and revenue** - Delivered across Google projects, Klein, energy startup despite reactive approach
3. **Giant leaps in agentic coding abilities** - Enabled to build results that weren't previously possible

### Would do differently:
- **Better segmentation of work time and family time** - The December vacation pattern (working on laptop, wife seeing him as always working, not actually recharging) exemplifies this gap. Trying to do better today based on this recognition.

### Lessons carrying forward:
1. **Leveraging AI agents in bigger and bigger ways** - Continuous expansion of what's possible with AI agents
2. **Looking for new ways to partner with people I enjoy working with** - Shift from solo consulting to partnership models (Gastown Hall pattern, Agent OS collaboration)
3. **Wanting to do better splitting work and family time** - Active intention to improve boundaries

## Looking Forward

### What's calling/exciting:
1. **Code Army + Eli productization** - The two personal projects becoming real products
2. **Partnership opportunities** - Gastown Hall model (partnering with friend's open source project), Agent OS collaboration (free inference, platform capabilities)
3. **Joint venture with Don and Savas** - Potential startup idea they've been discussing, though he sees those ideas as features for Eli (consolidation thinking)
4. **Building partnerships with people he enjoys working with** - Theme from lessons learned

### What feels heavy/would drop:
- **Consulting** - Would rather work on own projects, but likes the money (core tension: autonomy vs. revenue)

### Fears/concerns:
- **Financial gap management** - Without consulting revenue, needs to dip into investments for salary and health insurance. Can do it, just would rather not.
- **Psychological vs. actual runway** - Has the financial runway, but psychological comfort with earning vs. drawing down is different
