# Year 2026 Intentions

## Looking Back at 2025

### Proud of:
1. **Health transformation and results** - Lost 60 lbs, A1C out of prediabetes range, established 5-6 day/week exercise habit (water aerobics + weightlifting)
2. **High-quality consulting delivery and revenue** - Delivered across Google projects, Klein, energy startup despite reactive approach
3. **Giant leaps in agentic coding abilities** - Enabled to build results that weren't previously possible

### Would do differently:
- **Better segmentation of work time and family time** - The December vacation pattern (working on laptop, wife seeing him as always working, not actually recharging) exemplifies this gap. Trying to do better today based on this recognition.

### Lessons carrying forward:
1. **Leveraging AI agents in bigger and bigger ways** - Continuous expansion of what's possible with AI agents
2. **Looking for new ways to partner with people I enjoy working with** - Shift from solo consulting to partnership models (Gastown Hall pattern, Agent OS collaboration)
3. **Wanting to do better splitting work and family time** - Active intention to improve boundaries
