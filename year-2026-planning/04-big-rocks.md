# Year 2026 Big Rocks

## Rock Table (Post-Board Revision)

| Key | Slogan | Outcome | Value |
|-----|--------|---------|-------|
| PRO2 | "Build with friends, validate with users" | 100 paying customers by December 31, 2026 | Building in flow state with people I enjoy; shifting from solo consulting to partnership models; leveraging AI agents in bigger and bigger ways; openness and integrity in working with friends; this is who I am as a builder |
| PRO1 | "Partner through purpose" | Strategic consulting only when it builds startup infrastructure/partnerships; self-fund runway through investment | Consulting becomes tactic within strategy, not competing priority; maintains relationships that matter; reclaims 50-100 days for product development |
| PRI1 | "Finish strong, be fully present" | 100 lb weight loss goal achieved + work/family boundaries working (vacation pattern fixed) | Integrity in my marriage and family relationships; being present matters more than being productive; completing what I started (100 lb commitment); the December vacation pattern doesn't define me anymore |

## Force Ranking

### Professional
1. **PRO2** - "If only ONE professional thing" - Build with friends, validate with users (100 paying customers)
2. **PRO1** - "If only TWO" - Partner through purpose (strategic consulting only)

**Rationale:** PRO2 is "not even close" - the startup with paying customers is the dream. PRO1 now *serves* PRO2 rather than competing with it.

### Personal
1. **PRI1** - "If only ONE personal thing" - Finish strong, be fully present (health + boundaries)

## Board-Driven Revisions

| Original | Revised | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| PRO1: "Earn the runway, choose the work" — $200K consulting | "Partner through purpose" — Strategic consulting only; self-fund runway | Fear-based planning transformed; "investing in my company" feels like offense, not retreat; reclaims 50-100 days |
| PRO2 outcome: "Validated foundation" | "100 paying customers by EOY" | "Validated" was ambiguous; paying customers are concrete validation signal |

## Consolidated Out

These candidates were folded into the Big Rocks above:

| Candidate | Reason Not Selected / How Consolidated |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Launch Code Army product | Consolidated into PRO2 as path (a) - outcome-based approach allows flexibility |
| Launch Eli product | Consolidated into PRO2 as path (b) - outcome-based approach allows flexibility |
| Productize the integration (AI COO/Chief of Staff) | Consolidated into PRO2 as path (c) - outcome-based approach allows flexibility |
| Build audience/community for products | Implicit in PRO2's "validate with users" - audience building is part of validation |
| Form partnerships (Don, Rory, Jeff, Jesse, Steve) | Explicit in PRO2 as path (b) - "partners engaged" is a key outcome measure |
| Maintain health transformation (exercise, A1C) | Consolidated into PRI1 - maintaining 5-6 days/week exercise is how the 100 lb goal happens |
| Establish work/family boundaries | Consolidated into PRI1 - "be fully present" and "vacation pattern fixed" captures this |
| $200K consulting revenue | Transformed—self-fund runway instead; only strategic consulting that serves PRO2 |

## Key Insights

**Why 3 rocks instead of 6-7:**
- Outcome-based framing (PRO2) gives flexibility across Code Army, Eli, or integrated approaches
- Allows pivoting based on what gains traction without feeling like failure
- "100 paying customers" is concrete validation without requiring profitability
- Consolidation prevents project-specific thinking and enables strategic flexibility

**The original tension resolved:**
- PRO1 and PRO2 were in tension: consulting took time from startup building
- Board simulation surfaced that fear of "dipping into savings" was frame, not fact
- Reframing as "investing in my company" dissolved psychological barrier
- PRO1 revised to serve PRO2: strategic consulting only, filter everything else out

**Through-line emerged:**
*"Build what I see, with people I trust, and let the market validate."*
