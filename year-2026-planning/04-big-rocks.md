# Year 2026 Big Rocks

## Rock Table

| Key | Slogan | Outcome | Value |
|-----|--------|---------|-------|
| PRO2 | "Build with friends, validate with users" | Startup foundation validated through: (a) Code Army MVP with early adopters, (b) Eli productized with partners engaged (Don, Rory, Jeff, Jesse, Steve), or (c) Integrated offering showing traction | Building in flow state with people I enjoy; shifting from solo consulting to partnership models; leveraging AI agents in bigger and bigger ways; openness and integrity in working with friends; this is who I am as a builder |
| PRO1 | "Earn the runway, choose the work" | $200K new 2026 consulting revenue booked | Maintains integrity by earning rather than drawing down savings; resolves the psychological discomfort of tapping investments; creates space to focus on work that keeps me in flow state without financial anxiety |
| PRI1 | "Finish strong, be fully present" | 100 lb weight loss goal achieved + work/family boundaries working (vacation pattern fixed) | Integrity in my marriage and family relationships; being present matters more than being productive; completing what I started (100 lb commitment); the December vacation pattern doesn't define me anymore |

## Force Ranking

### Professional
1. **PRO2** - "If only ONE professional thing" - Build with friends, validate with users (startup foundation)
2. **PRO1** - "If only TWO" - Earn the runway, choose the work (consulting revenue)

**Rationale:** PRO2 is "not even close" - the startup foundation with friends is the dream, the Destination Postcard vision. PRO1 is necessary but not the true north.

### Personal
1. **PRI1** - "If only ONE personal thing" - Finish strong, be fully present (health + boundaries)

## Consolidated Out

These candidates were folded into the Big Rocks above:

| Candidate | Reason Not Selected / How Consolidated |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Launch Code Army product | Consolidated into PRO2 as path (a) - outcome-based approach allows flexibility |
| Launch Eli product | Consolidated into PRO2 as path (b) - outcome-based approach allows flexibility |
| Productize the integration (AI COO/Chief of Staff) | Consolidated into PRO2 as path (c) - outcome-based approach allows flexibility |
| Build audience/community for products | Implicit in PRO2's "validate with users" - audience building is part of validation |
| Form partnerships (Don, Rory, Jeff, Jesse, Steve) | Explicit in PRO2 as path (b) - "partners engaged" is a key outcome measure |
| Maintain health transformation (exercise, A1C) | Consolidated into PRI1 - maintaining 5-6 days/week exercise is how the 100 lb goal happens |
| Establish work/family boundaries | Consolidated into PRI1 - "be fully present" and "vacation pattern fixed" captures this |

## Key Insights

**Why 3 rocks instead of 6-7:**
- Outcome-based framing (PRO2) gives flexibility across Code Army, Eli, or integrated approaches
- Allows pivoting based on what gains traction without feeling like failure
- "Validated foundation" (users, partners, momentum) is the right 2026 outcome since no startup revenue expected
- Consolidation prevents project-specific thinking and enables strategic flexibility

**The tension acknowledged:**
- PRO1 and PRO2 are in tension: consulting takes time from startup building
- PRO1 exists to resolve psychological discomfort (earning vs. drawing down)
- But PRO2 is "not even close" as the priority when forced to choose
- This tension will surface in quarterly planning and daily choices
